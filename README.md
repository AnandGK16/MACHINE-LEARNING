# Machine Learning Project Readme

## Outlier Detection and Removal

In this project, we aim to detect and remove outliers from the dataset using various methods:

1. **Mean Function:** Outliers will be identified by comparing data points with the mean of the dataset.

2. **Percentile Method:** Outliers will be detected based on their position relative to the data distribution using percentiles.

3. **Interquartile Range (IQR) Method:** Outliers will be identified using the IQR, which is the range between the first and third quartiles of the data.

4. **Normal Distribution:** Outliers will be detected based on their deviation from the normal distribution assumption.

5. **Z-score Method:** Outliers will be identified by calculating the z-score of each data point and comparing it to a threshold.

## Hypothesis Testing

### Q1: Child Psychologist's Claim

A child psychologist claims that the average time working mothers spend talking to their children is at least 11 minutes per day. We conduct a random sample of 1000 working mothers and find they spend an average of 11.5 minutes per day talking with their children. 

- Population Standard Deviation: 2.3 minutes
- Sample Size: 1000
- Sample Mean: 11.5 minutes
- Significance Level: α = 0.05

We perform a hypothesis test to determine if there is enough evidence to support the psychologist's claim.

### Q2: Coffee Shop's Claim

A coffee shop claims that their average wait time for customers is less than 5 minutes. To test this claim, a sample of 40 customers is taken, and their wait times are recorded. 

- Sample Size: 40
- Sample Mean Wait Time: 4.6 minutes
- Sample Standard Deviation: 0.8 minutes
- Significance Level: α = 0.05

We perform a hypothesis test to determine if there is enough evidence to support the coffee shop's claim.
